            <h3>UnityRTGI</h3>
            <img src="img/unityrtgi.png" alt="path" style="width: 30%">
            <p>This project was written in C# using the Unity Engine. It is a geometry importer script for unity where the user can import geometry assets in execution time without the needing of compile it with the project.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>MONO</h3>
            <img src="img/mono.png" alt="path" style="width: 30%">
            <p>This project was written in C# using the Unity Engine to a hackaton competition. It is a puzzle/platform game where the player changes the world colors between black and white to solve the puzzles and advance in the history. This game presents his own identity by having a simple mechanic and a minimalist design, and this combination was the key to make this game so unique and to give to all players some hours of fun even in the alpha version.
            </p>
          </div>
            <h3>S.I.R.A.C</h3>
            <img src="img/sirac.png" alt="path" style="width: 30%">
            <p>This project was fully written in C++11 using the OpenCV library. This project is a computer vision algorithm that track bats in a clutter environment to account the population of their colony. The algorithm is able to start detections, treat wrong or lost detections and process the detections in progress. A 3D viewer was also implemented in order to help the analysis of the tracked flights by researchers in areas like biodiversity and biology.

            <h3>x:pression</h3>
            <img src="img/xpression.png" alt="path" style="width: 30%">
            <p>This project was fully written in C++11 early 2016, using the CLM-framework to VR/AR course at CIn UFPE. This project is a computer vision algorithm that makes a real time tracking of the user's face and detect the actual emotion based on the extracted features. It was my first experience with a face detection algorithm.

            <h3>Features Extractor</h3>
			      <img src="img/featuresextractor.png" alt="path" style="width: 30%">
            <p>This project was fully written in C++11 early 2015, using the OpenCV and OpenGL libraries to the Computer Graphics course at CIn UFPE. It is a computer vision algorithm that extract features of a given texture, find the texture as a surface on the webcam image, calculate the pose of the detected surface and project a 3D object on the surface using the texture as a AR marker.</p>

            <h3>3D Render</h3>
            <img src="img/3drender.png" alt="path" style="width: 30%">
            <p>This project was fully written in C++11 early 2015, using the OpenGL library to the Computer Graphics course at CIn UFPE. It is a computer graphics algorithm that read .obj files and create 3D scenes with all objects rendered.</p>
          </div>

            <h3>Simplifique GP</h3>
            <p>It is a confidential project under development in Voxar Labs. In this project I am an undergraduate researcher and software engineer.</p>
